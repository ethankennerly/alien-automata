A videogame concept made in 2 days.
September 1-2, 2012
Version 0.1

Last weekend John Wilkinson, Dave Alleca, and I made a game for Ludum Jam.
The theme was "Evolution."
We brainstormed ideas, including mixing Conway's Game of Life with Space Invaders.
We expected it would be too chaotic.
This weekend I wanted to make another game, and sessions of Conway's Life monopolized my imagination.
